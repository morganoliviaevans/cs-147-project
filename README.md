# Smarter Playtime: Developing a Motion-Based Motorized Cat Toy for Active Engagement

## Project Overview

This repository contains the files for **"Smarter Playtime"**, a project developed as part of **CS 147: Internet of Things (IoT) Software and Systems**. The project aims to provide active engagement for cats through a motorized toy that incorporates motion detection, customizable features, and automated play patterns to keep cats entertained.

## Motivation

Many cat toys available today fail to keep cats consistently entertained, leading to a lack of exercise and stimulation. This can cause behavioral and health problems for pets, creating stress for both cats and their owners. Our project aims to solve this by providing a customizable, automated solution to ensure cats stay active and engaged.

## Project Goals

The project aims to develop a motorized toy with interchangeable attachments (feathers, bells, ribbons, etc.), automated movement that detects proximity, and visual stimulation via LEDs. The toy will use a rechargeable power source for convenience and long-term usability.
